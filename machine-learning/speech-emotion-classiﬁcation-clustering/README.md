# Speach emotion classification and clustering

Speach emotion classification and clustering including:
1. Recorded and collected the audio of words spoken by 1300 individuals.
2. Preprocessed and extracted audio features: MFCC, Zero Crossing Rate, Root Mean Square, Chroma, Spectral Centroid and Spectral Bandwidth.
3. Built models for classiÔ¨Åcation: MLP, SVM, RF, D3, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Gaussian Process classifier, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Quadric Discriminant Analysis, etc.
4. Clustered emotions: K-Means, DBSCAN etc.
