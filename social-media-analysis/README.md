   * Recorded the number of followers, retweets, impressions, etc. and built a graph of retweets in Gephi.
   * Calculated hub, authority, in/out degree and page rank for each account in the graph.
   * Run the k-core algorithm to remove the graph directions and calculate the k-shell for each node.
   * Find communities using the Louvain and InfoMap algorithms.
   * Propose an algorithm to find out if an account is a human or a robot based on its activities.
