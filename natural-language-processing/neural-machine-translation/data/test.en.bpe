more than 90 people were killed and hundreds were injured .
the danger was particularly pronounced at high tides .
several districts in bang￭ k￭ ok - which barely sits above flood level - are facing serious flooding , including one tied to a break in a flood barrier at k￭ long ma￭ ha￭ saw￭ at , according to the m￭ co￭ t news agency .

but the prime minister assured residents saturday tap water and electricity would be available , but with disruptions .
meanwhile , the ministry of public health transferred 2￭ 80 of the capital '￭ s 5￭ 20 patients in severe condition to 22 hospitals up￭ country , the news agency reported .

also saturday , the sunday telegraph published an interview with em￭ batt￭ led syrian president bashar al - assad , which it said was his first with a western journalist since the start of the uprising seven months ago .
in it , the president warns western countries not to intervene in his country .
syria is the hub now in this region , said al - assad , the british newspaper reported .
it is the fault line , and if you play with the ground you will cause an earthquake .
do you want to see another afghanistan , or tens of afghan￭ istans ?

australian airline q￭ ant￭ as remained gr￭ ounded for a second day sunday , leaving tens of thousands of stranded passengers worldwide awaiting an independent watchdog '￭ s decision in the labor dispute .
at sydney airport , columns of canceled illuminated the departure board .
thr￭ on￭ gs of weary passengers crowded the help desk to re￭ book with other airlines as su￭ it￭ cases lay scattered all over the floor .
in a statement , q￭ ant￭ as pilots slammed the airline '￭ s chief executive for gr￭ ounding the entire fleet , saying it is unfair to passengers , shareholders and workers .
alan joyce obviously thinks q￭ ant￭ as is his personal play￭ thing to use in his high - st￭ akes game against pilots and other workers , said richard wood￭ ward , the president of the australian and international pilots association .
union officials have accused the airline of planning to out￭ source ground jobs at a cost of thousands of australian jobs , and putting profits first .
pay and working conditions have also been at the center of the disputes .
the industrial action is aimed at ensuring q￭ ant￭ as will not have enough funds to set up overseas operations that will jeop￭ ardi￭ ze job security , union officials said .
my message to q￭ ant￭ as , the employees and trade unions is : austr￭ alians do want to see this dispute sorted out .
q￭ ant￭ as is an iconic australian brand , it is the emplo￭ yer of thousands of austr￭ alians , thousands of people rely on it for their livelihoods and we do need this dispute to be brought to an end , she said .
beginning monday , the airline will lock out all employees involved in the dispute , he said .
the gr￭ ounding will have a daily financial impact of about 20 million australian dollars ( $ 21 ￭.￭ 4 million ) , q￭ ant￭ as said .
customers booked on q￭ ant￭ as flights should not go to the airport until further notice , the airline said .
it will offer travel￭ ers full re￭ funds or the chance to re￭ book .
however , flights with subsidiaries , including je￭ t￭ star and q￭ ant￭ as￭ link , are not affected .
it '￭ s a mani￭ ac￭ al over￭ reaction , said richard wood￭ ward , vice president of the australian and international pilots union .
the decision to ground the q￭ ant￭ as fleet , str￭ anding thousands of passengers around the world , was unnecessary and grossly irresponsible , he said in a statement .
q￭ ant￭ as , which has its headquarters in sydney , is the second oldest airline in the world , and marked its 90￭ th anniversary last year .
it emplo￭ ys about 32 , 500 people and flies to more than 180 dest￭ inations worldwide , according to the company website .
the israeli air force struck several sites that it suspected were terror centers sunday , as the wave of back - and - forth attacks between the israeli military and palestinian militants continued .
the air force said the sunday attacks targeted three suspected rocket launching sites and one terror tunnel in northern gaza ; and two terror activity sites in southern gaza .
there was no word from the palestinian sides whether the strikes caused casualties .
the violence began when two islamic jihad commanders were among seven militants killed saturday by israeli strikes targeting a training camp in rafah , gaza , a spokesman for the militant group and medical sources reported .
the israeli military said more than 20 mort￭ ars and rockets were subsequently fired into their territory .
a 55 - year - old man was killed in the rocket attacks and 20 others were injured , according to zaki hel￭ er , an emergency services spokesman in israel .

two other members of his organization were injured in that attack , he said .
witnesses reported that at least 10 other people were wounded .
militi￭ as from the libyan city of mis￭ r￭ ata have beaten and killed displaced residents from the nearby town of ta￭ wer￭ gha , accusing them of si￭ ding with pro - gadhafi forces and committing violent crimes in mis￭ r￭ ata , according to a report by human rights watch .
local authorities and mis￭ r￭ ata residents widely accuse ta￭ wer￭ gh￭ ans of having committed serious crimes - including murders and rap￭ es - in mis￭ r￭ ata with forces loyal to ou￭ sted libyan leader mo￭ ammar gadhafi , human rights watch said .
the group said pro - gadhafi forces used ta￭ wer￭ gha as a base for attacks on mis￭ r￭ ata and the surrounding area from march until august .
many ta￭ wer￭ gh￭ ans supported the 42 - year ruler , whose regime claimed that libyan opposition fighters would en￭ slave ta￭ wer￭ gh￭ ans if they took power , human rights watch said .
the group said ta￭ wer￭ gha - once a town of 30 , 000 residents - is now abandoned , with some areas r￭ ans￭ acked and burned .
most of the ta￭ wer￭ gh￭ ans interviewed by the group said they had fled in mid - august , when libyan opposition forces entered the town .
militi￭ as quickly forced out those who remained , the group said .
they came outside my house and told us we had to leave our homes , 80 - year - old muhammad gra￭ yr￭ a ta￭ wer￭ gi , a retired date farmer , told the rights group .
we were unarmed .
human rights watch called for libya '￭ s new leadership - the national transitional council - to bring central control and accountability to the more than 100 armed groups from mis￭ r￭ ata .
revenge against the people from ta￭ wer￭ gha , whatever the accusations against them , undermines the goal of the libyan revolution , sarah leah whit￭ son , middle east and north africa director of human rights watch said in a statement .
in the new libya , ta￭ wer￭ gh￭ ans accused of wrongdoing should be prosecuted based on the law , not subject to vigil￭ ante justice .
at least 17 people were killed in central kabul on saturday when a suicide bomber struck a vehicle in a military convoy , according to officials .
five troops and eight civilians were killed in the attack , nato '￭ s international security assistance force said .
afghan officials said four afghans , including two students , were also killed .
among the dead was master corporal byr￭ on gre￭ ff , a canadian , according to the canadian expedi￭ tionary force command .
it was not immediately clear whether he was included in the isaf - provided figure .
the u ￭.￭ s ￭. official emphasized details are continuing to un￭ fold .
a heavily damaged vehicle was believed to be an armored bus that was carrying u ￭.￭ s ￭. troops from one base to another .
a senior nato official identified it as a custom - built , heavily armored rhino .
the attack caused a number of nato and local afghan casualties , isaf said in a statement .
four afghans , including two students , were also killed , said hash￭ mat stan￭ ik￭ zai , spokesman for kabul '￭ s police chief .
afghan president hamid karzai offered his sympath￭ ies to the families of the victims in a statement and said the cowardly character of the attack demonstrates the very evil and hein￭ ous nature of the enemy .
a taliban spokesman confirmed saturday '￭ s attack in a text message , saying it killed 16 foreign soldiers , one civilian and injured many others .
taliban casualty counts are often infl￭ ated ; there was no other reliable indication 16 foreigners were killed .
a gun￭ man wearing an afghan army uniform turned his weapon on coalition forces during training , killing three and wounding several others , isaf said .
the shoo￭ ter was killed in the incident in southern afghanistan .
i am both saddened and outr￭ aged by the attacks that took place today against coalition forces and the people of afghanistan , allen said in a statement .
the enemies of peace are not martyrs , but murder￭ ers .
to hide the fact that they are losing territory , support , and the will to fight , our common enemy continues to employ suicide attackers to kill innocent afghan fathers , mothers , sons and daughters , as well as the coalition forces who have volunte￭ ered to protect them .
the u ￭.￭ s ￭. - led war in afghanistan marked its 10￭ th year earlier this month having passed two major mil￭ est￭ ones .
the taliban has been forced out of power and osama bin laden is dead .
but afghanistan has been hit by a wave of high - profile attacks in recent months that have jeop￭ ardi￭ zed the peace negotiations .
september '￭ s tur￭ ban bomb assassination of former afghan president bur￭ han￭ uddin rabbani , re￭ vered by many as a father of the muja￭ he￭ deen movement that ou￭ sted the so￭ vie￭ ts in the 1980 s , appears to have dealt the biggest blow to the peace process .
rabbani was the chairman of president karzai '￭ s high council for peace , which has been trying for a year to foster dialogue with the taliban - a strategy that karzai publicly abandoned following rabbani '￭ s killing .
nearly 2 , 800 troops from the united states and its partners have died during the 10 years of war , according to a cnn count .

dozens of emergency vehicles , including am￭ bu￭ lan￭ ces and police cars , were on the scene overnight saturday .
some of the miners family members waiting at the site periodically erupted in tears as the night unfolded .

according to xinhua , x￭ i￭ ali￭ u￭ ch￭ ong coal mine is state - owned and has been in operation for 40 years .
it is legally operated , with more than 160 miners typically on site .

ye￭ in matthew , the government spokesman , said the attacks in ma￭ yo￭ m were carried out against civilians by militi￭ as of the south sudan liberation army .
since then , the world '￭ s newest nation has been challeng￭ ed by a number of rebel militi￭ as .
led by former officers of the southern army that fought khartoum in a 22 - year civil war , the militi￭ as have taken up arms against their former comrades for various reasons .

mc￭ gu￭ in￭ ness is expected to return to his role as northern ireland '￭ s deputy first minister .
the long counting process started friday with hi￭ gg￭ ins confirmed as the winner late saturday .

the violence began when two islamic jihad commanders were among seven militants killed saturday by israeli strikes targeting a training camp in rafah , gaza , a spokesman for the militant group and medical sources reported .

former brazilian president lu￭ i￭ z in￭ ac￭ io l￭ ula da sil￭ va will begin ch￭ emo￭ therapy in the coming days to treat a malignant tumor in his lar￭ y￭ n￭ x , a hospital official said saturday .
this is a loc￭ alized tumor , noted bo￭ ge￭ a , meaning that it has not spread elsewhere in the body .
she added that the tumor has not me￭ ta￭ st￭ as￭ ized , a characteristic of most can￭ cer￭ ous cells .
finance minister guid￭ o man￭ te￭ ga told reporters that he attended l￭ ula '￭ s birthday party last week and noticed that his voice sounded hoarse .
on saturday , man￭ te￭ ga predicted l￭ ula would beat cancer .
he noted that former first lady mar￭ isa le￭ tici￭ a has been with l￭ ula ever since he came to the hospital for a check - up on friday .
he is a fighter , man￭ te￭ ga told reporters , adding he expected l￭ ula will leave the hospital later saturday .
he has overcome lesser obstacles and will overcome this one as well .
founded in 19￭ 21 by syrian and lebanese immigrants , the facility '￭ s staff has also treated par￭ agu￭ ay '￭ s president fer￭ nan￭ do lu￭ go and former brazilian vice president jose al￭ en￭ car , who died in march after a long battle against ab￭ dom￭ inal cancer .

as you all know , i went through the same thing , with the competent team of the syrian - lebanese hospital , which allowed me to completely recover , she said .
i am sure the same thing will happen to president l￭ ula .
he is widely credited with helping steer the nation into becoming an economic power￭ house , leaving office last year with high approval ratings .
presidents , however , are barred from running for a third consecutive term .
as the dust settled after the latest agreement was struck to solve the eurozone debt crisis , french president nic￭ ol￭ as sarkozy admitted it had been a mistake to admit the stricken greeks into the monetary union .
when l￭ ula turned 66 years - old last thursday , he addressed the brazilian public via the internet , saying that he had dedicated more than half his half to improving brazil '￭ s democracy .
greece came into the euro with numbers that were false and its economy was not prepared to assume an integration into the eurozone .
it was a decision that was taken in , i believe , 2001 , for which we now are paying the consequence .
wednesday '￭ s agreement , reached in brussels , will sl￭ ash greek debt , rec￭ ap￭ it￭ alize european banks and more than double the european union bailout fund '￭ s resources to handle future sovereign de￭ faults .
it '￭ s great news that we '￭ ve got an agreement , said deutsche bank economist gil￭ les mo￭ ec .
when europe puts its heads together , they do actually begin to cooperate .
china has welcomed the eu summit consensus , whose main elements include a 50 % reduction in the value of greek government bonds , steps rec￭ ap￭ it￭ alize european banks and plans to attract capital for the already overbur￭ dened european financial stability facility rescue fund , in order to reduce greek debt from the current astronom￭ ical 160 % of its current economy to 120 % of total economic output over the next 10 years .
we believe that , as the largest economy in the world , the steady , sound , and healthy growth of the eu economy and the eurozone is vital to the world economy '￭ s recovery , foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang y￭ u said at a regular press briefing on thursday .
we are also ready to work with the eu to overcome the difficulty .
but chinese support would depend on europe '￭ s ability to guarantee the safety of any investment , li da￭ o￭ ku￭ i , a member of china '￭ s central bank monetary policy committee , told the financial times .
it is in china '￭ s long - term and intrinsic interest to help europe because they are our biggest trading partner but the chief concern of the chinese government is how to explain this decision to our own people , li said .
europe hopes to attract capital from sovereign wealth funds , particularly from developing nations like china and russia , to supplement the 4￭ 40 billion rescue fund , but analysts note that the structure of these investments remains unknown .
in a phone conversation with sarkozy on thursday , chinese president hu j￭ in￭ ta￭ o made no mention of specific plans to invest in the scheme , but lau￭ ded europe '￭ s progress in solving the debt crisis .
the leaders discussed plans for the up￭ coming g ￭20 summit , with hu saying the annual meeting had become a platform for cleaning up the global economy and that he hopes it can continue to adhere to the spirit of cooperation and common success , china '￭ s state - run xinhua news agency reported .
it is not in china '￭ s interest to fund this scheme , carl we￭ in￭ berg , chief economist at high frequency economics told cnn money .
it is better advised to sit this out and buy assets at liqu￭ idation than to invest in a sinking ship .
meanwhile the eu '￭ s bailout fund chief kla￭ us reg￭ ling will meet with officials in beijing and tokyo friday , though no reason has been given for his visit .
in the sunday telegraph interview , mr assad said western countries are going to rat￭ chet up the pressure , definitely .
syria is the hub now in this region .
it is the fa￭ ul￭ t￭ line , and if you play with the ground you will cause an earthquake , he said , .
any problem in syria will burn the whole region .
if the plan is to divide syria , that is to divide the whole region .
president assad admitted that many mistakes had been made by his security forces in the early part of the uprising , but the paper said he insisted that only terrorists were now being targeted .
we '￭ ve been fighting the muslim brotherhood since the 1950 s and we are still fighting with them , he said .
the latest statement from un secretary - general ban ki - moon said mr assad must respond to demands for change with serious reform , not repression and violence , and called for an immediate halt to military operations .
his calls ech￭ o those of members of the arab league who on friday sent an urgent message to the syrian government , denouncing the continued killings of civilians taking part in protests .
the league '￭ s ministerial committee on the syrian crisis also urged damascus to take the necessary measures to protect civilians .
on saturday , two of the country '￭ s main activist groups , the british - based syrian observatory for human rights and the local co - ordin￭ ating committees , said shells slammed into the baba am￭ r district of hom￭ s .
reuters news agency reported one person was shot dead by a sni￭ per and two were killed during mach￭ ine￭ gun fire between mr assad '￭ s forces and def￭ ectors in the city .
activists said that 21 civilians had been killed on saturday , including 12 in ha￭ ma and three in hom￭ s .
in another incident near hom￭ s , up to 20 syrian soldiers were killed and 53 wounded in clashes with presumed army deser￭ ters , according to ag￭ ence france presse .
in a separate incident , 10 security agents and a deser￭ ter were killed in a bus ambush near the turkish border , afp reported , quoting activists .
the observatory said the bus was transporting security agents between the villages of al - habit and kaf￭ r￭ nab￭ uda in id￭ li￭ b province when it was am￭ bushed by armed men , probably deser￭ ters .
the two technology firms are not the only ones exploring the area .
less well known companies , including qual￭ com￭ m and extreme reality 3 d , have also acted to secure touch￭ less control patent rights .
it '￭ s interesting that so many companies are actually investing some very serious time and money into it , said chris green , a technology analyst at davies murphy group .
apple '￭ s fil￭ ing , entitled real time video process control using gestures , describes controlling images on a device , such as an iphone , without touching it , and the ability to transfer the pictures to one of the firm '￭ s other products using contact - free hand movements .
it suggests in￭ fr￭ ared , optical and other sensors would be used to detect the movements .
one use could be to transfer a video from a mobile phone by fl￭ icking it to a television .
say you '￭ re brow￭ sing a tv app on your phone and you found a programme you wanted to record , you could literally - just with a wave - take that programme and throw it to the other device using a gesture rather than using a blue￭ to￭ oth or cable connection , said mr green .
the firm '￭ s former chief executive , steve jobs , appears to have hinted at the prospect to his bio￭ grapher .
walter is￭ sac￭ son wrote : he very much wanted to do for television sets what he had done for computers , music players , and phones : make them simple and elegant .
mr is￭ a￭ ac￭ son quoted mr jobs as saying : it will have the simplest user interface you could imagine .
i finally cracked it .
microsoft '￭ s kin￭ ect system has been widely praised for its accuracy and clarity , and even university research departments are using the kin￭ ect devices , hacking them and using them for their projects , said mr green .

in early april , jon cor￭ z￭ ine was in a tough spot .
m￭ f global , the company he had run for the previous year , was about to post a fourth - quarter loss , marking its fourth successive fiscal year of red ink .
for the former gold￭ man s￭ achs chief , it was a set￭ back to his efforts to turn m￭ f global around .
he needed his traders to step up their game , and he called a group of them into a conference room at its man￭ h￭ att￭ an headquarters to lay out the plan .
he had just announced a plan for the bank to boost trading risk by holding more assets on its books , both to help customers and to bet on markets .
the trading , particularly in debt from troubled euro zone nations in the past year , has instead driven the firm to the br￭ ink of collapse , making it possibly the most prominent u ￭.￭ s ￭. casualty yet from the euro zone crisis .
it has also badly hurt cor￭ z￭ ine '￭ s business image , and reduced the former new jersey governor '￭ s chances of ever making a political come￭ back .
cor￭ z￭ ine could not be reached for comment and m￭ f global declined comment .
the firm was in talks with possible buyers on sunday , though sources said all options were on the table as it had hired restructuring and bankruptcy advisers .
m￭ f global '￭ s fate has raised questions about whether the 64 - year - old cor￭ z￭ ine '￭ s aff￭ inity for risk - taking has finally caught up to him after a career that took him to the top ec￭ hel￭ ons of wall street and then into politics as a u ￭.￭ s ￭. senator and to the new jersey state governor '￭ s man￭ sion .
cor￭ z￭ ine still has supporters on wall street who argue he was caught in a perfect storm but his de￭ tractors argue there have long been signs that cor￭ z￭ ine could take imp￭ rud￭ ent risks .
they point to gold￭ man s￭ achs major trading losses under his watch in 1994 , or when he sustained serious injuries in 2007 as a passenger in a speeding sports utility vehicle while not wearing a se￭ at￭ belt .
he said in a call with analysts last tuesday that m￭ f global sought to take advantage of dis￭ locations in the sovereign debt market by buying what it saw as relatively low risk paper .
in interviews with more than a dozen former employees and competitors , a portrait emer￭ ges of cor￭ z￭ ine struggling to transform the firm by ram￭ ping up risk .
his strategic shift did not sit well with some employees , and came at a time when credit ratings agencies and financial markets are very un￭ forgiving of high - risk strategies .
the business model is n '￭ t what it used to be , said patrick arb￭ or , a former chairman of the chicago board of trade and a long - time executive of a clearing bro￭ ker .
cor￭ z￭ ine could have shrunk m￭ f global '￭ s balance sheet or re￭ structured .
with the support of the board - which in a recent regulatory fil￭ ing applau￭ ded cor￭ z￭ ine '￭ s choice - he embar￭ ked on the strategy of trans￭ forming the company into what the fil￭ ing described as a commodities - and capital markets - focused investment bank .
while before , m￭ f global would link buyers up with sellers , or place trad￭ es on an exchange , the company would now hold an inventory of securities , potentially sitting on positions for longer , and betting on their price movements .
carrying inv￭ ent￭ ories usually requires more capital .
but it seemed like a good move at a time when larger banks such as gold￭ man were being forced to limit their risk - taking because of increased regulation , according to a company presentation .
brad ab￭ el￭ ow , a former gold￭ man colleague who served as his chief of staff and treasurer during his new jersey gu￭ ber￭ nat￭ or￭ ial term , was named president and chief operating officer .
other senior people joined , including ci￭ ti￭ group fixed income veteran richard moore in london who became the firm '￭ s european head .
cor￭ z￭ ine also hired hedge fund veteran munir ja￭ ver￭ i as global head of trading , and to oversee proprietary trading .
in an environment with limited capital and limited distribution , the game is about singles and doubles , because if you go for a home run and miss , you might not live to play another day , said one m￭ f trader who worked before and during cor￭ z￭ ine '￭ s re￭ ign .
there was an enormous misunderstanding of the firm '￭ s assets and reach , he added .
some sales staff complained that the firm was short on risk management , something companies like gold￭ man pride themselves on .
inter￭ nec￭ ine squ￭ ab￭ bles among traders , sal￭ es￭ people and ban￭ kers are common at an investment bank , particularly when massive changes in strategy create internal winners and lo￭ sers .
but to cor￭ z￭ ine '￭ s critics , his jump into sectors such as european debt investing brought serious risk .
as of october 25 , the company had about $ 6 ￭.￭ 3 billion of european sovereign debt from some of the euro zone '￭ s more peripheral and troubled countries , including italy , spain , portu￭ gal , ireland and belgium , though not greece .
but m￭ f global '￭ s overall capital levels leave it with little margin for error .
the company '￭ s book equity comp￭ ares to an eye - popping $ 41 ￭.￭ 05 billion of assets , which means if the value of m￭ f global '￭ s assets falls more than about 3 percent , the company has wiped out the whole of its equity cushion and is out of business .
even a 1 percent decline could leave it dang￭ er￭ ously under￭ capit￭ alized .
the firm '￭ s le￭ verage was on par with le￭ hman brothers , even if its assets were safer .
the company insisted it was being prud￭ ent with its risk taking .
in its most recently quarterly presentation last week , it argued it had low levels of il￭ liquid assets , known as level 3 assets .
it pointed out that european sovereign investments are relatively safe , because they mature relatively soon - by the end of 2012 - and the european financial stability facility back￭ stops these countries through mid 2013 .
i can '￭ t speak to m￭ f global , but if he applied the same process there as he did when was conducting the affairs of government , i have to say he is a thoughtful , careful and prud￭ ent busin￭ es￭ sper￭ son , said st￭ even gold￭ man , who served as cor￭ z￭ ine '￭ s commissioner of banking and insurance in new jersey from 2006 to 2009 and is now a partner at law firm k￭ ram￭ er levin naf￭ tal￭ is &￭ amp ￭; frankel .
decisions were never made from the hip .
deplo￭ ying $ 62 million of his ip￭ o boun￭ ty , he campaig￭ ned as a democrat dark - horse candidate in primary and general elections for a u ￭.￭ s ￭. senate seat from new jersey .
despite refusing to release his income tax records and g￭ aff￭ es such as when he jo￭ ked about it￭ alians who make cement shoes and were defended by jewish lawyers , he won the election .
after one term in which he made only a modest number of headlines , cor￭ z￭ ine in 2005 successfully campaig￭ ned to become new jersey governor .
he lost his campaign for re￭ election in 2009 to republican chris christie and a few months later answered the call from flowers , whose private equity firm j . c . flowers had invested $ 300 million in m￭ f global in 2008 , and joined the firm .
while he has many fans on wall street and beyond , some say his business and political careers are unlikely to recover from this latest blow .
whatever the outcome of talks over a sale or a restructuring few see much of a role for cor￭ z￭ ine in m￭ f global '￭ s future .
but the q￭ ant￭ as union ; which has been em￭ bro￭ iled in a year - long labor dispute pun￭ ctu￭ ated by rolling wal￭ k￭ outs ; was caught flat - foo￭ ted , as was the government of australian prime minister julia gill￭ ard and , of course , tens of thousands of q￭ ant￭ as passengers worldwide .
it '￭ s a mani￭ ac￭ al over￭ reaction , said richard wood￭ ward , vice president of the australian and international pilots union .
i think alan joyce is destroying the brand of q￭ ant￭ as ; he '￭ s holding the passengers for ransom as he black￭ ma￭ ils the government of australia .
australian assistant treasurer bill shor￭ ten labeled the decision a high - handed ambush .
we '￭ re conscious the australian economy has been put at great risk of damage due to the strike , shor￭ ten said .
labor relations tribunal fair work australia agreed , ordering an end to the labor dispute to avoid significant damage to the tourism industry .
joyce , a native of ireland , has been ceo of q￭ ant￭ as since 2008 , after a five - year tenure as ceo of je￭ t￭ star .
joyce has been pushing a restructuring that would put more focus on expanding its budget airline operations , start a new premi￭ um service outside of australia and cut some long - haul routes .
you will remember that early in the 2008 presidential campaign , barack obama sig￭ nal￭ ed that he was going to have a different foreign policy than george bush - and he chose as his example , iran .
he argued that simply pressur￭ ing the country was not a policy and obama offered to talk to iran '￭ s leaders .
well , two years into his presidency , obama '￭ s iran policy looks a lot like george w . bush '￭ s - pressure and more pressure .
the p￭ uni￭ tive tactics have paid off in some measure .
iran faces economic problems .
but they are also having a perver￭ se impact on the country , as i witnessed last week .
the sanctions are sti￭ fling growth , though not as much as one might imagine .
so the basic effect has been to weaken civil society and strengthen the state - the opposite of what we should be trying to do in that country .
by some estimates , iran '￭ s revolutionary guard - the hard - line element of the armed forces , supported by the supreme leader , now controls 40 % of the economy .
in fact , what is our goal ?
is it to overthrow the iranian regime ?
is it to make it bleed until it gives up its nuclear program ?
a wholesale revolution continues to strike me as a distant prospect .
the regime still has some domestic support , and it uses a mix of religious authority , patron￭ age and force quite effectively .
and we keep forgetting the inconvenient fact that , even if the regime changed , the nuclear energy program - which is popular as an expression of iranian nation￭ alism and power - will continue .
even the leaders of the green movement strongly support that program .
obama should return to his original approach and test the iranians to see if there is any room for dialogue and agreement .
engaging with iran , putting its nuclear program under some kind of supervision and finding areas of common interest ( such as afghanistan ) would all be important goals .
it might not work - the iranian regime is divided and often paralyzed itself - but it '￭ s worth trying .
strategic engagement with an adver￭ sary can go hand in hand with a policy that encourages change in that country .
that '￭ s how washington dealt with the soviet union and china in the 1970 s and 80 s .
iran is a country of 80 million people , educated and dynamic .
it sits a￭ stride a crucial part of the world .
it can not be sanc￭ tioned and pressed down forever .
it is the last great civilization to sit outside the global order .
we need a strategy that comb￭ ines pressure with a path to bring iran in from the cold .

brazil '￭ s government has loudly proclaimed a deal it says is worth $ 12 billion for taiwanese technology giant fo￭ x￭ con￭ n to produce i￭ pads and build a whole new industry based around scre￭ ens used in an array of consumer electronics from smar￭ t￭ phones to tel￭ ev￭ isi￭ ons .
but the in￭ famous brazil cost - shorthand for the bureaucr￭ acy and high taxes that plague business in the country - is already over￭ shadowing the deal , complicating negotiations with fo￭ x￭ con￭ n over the broader investment plan .
the likely need for large state subsidi￭ zed loans to l￭ ure fo￭ x￭ con￭ n also revi￭ ves concerns about the state '￭ s heavy hand in brazil '￭ s economy .
yet critics say brazil '￭ s shallow labor pool and poor infrastructure make it ill - prepared to make the leap to high - end work and that it risks being stuck at the low end - assembling components designed and made elsewhere .
at first , fo￭ x￭ con￭ n will have to fly in most of the key components such as semic￭ on￭ duc￭ tors , mo￭ dem￭ s and scre￭ ens from china , as brazil attempts to raise its ability to produce more of them locally .
we are selling our market very che￭ ap￭ ly , giving tax incentives for a company to come and produce something that is already developed in the world market , said jo￭ ao maria de oli￭ ve￭ ira , a researcher at the government - linked institute for applied economic research , or i￭ pe￭ a .
it '￭ s not something that adds much value and it w￭ o n '￭ t leave much here .
the amount of value added to apple products by fo￭ x￭ con￭ n '￭ s approximately one million workers in china is a mere $ 10 or so per device , according to a study by researchers at the university of california , ir￭ vine .
brazil has cut taxes and duties on tablet production in a move that should reduce the retail price by about a third and is pha￭ sing in production requirements to foster a local components industry .
separately , it is in talks with fo￭ x￭ con￭ n on a package of incentives , including priority customs access , more tax breaks and subsidi￭ zed loans from state development bank b￭ n￭ des to secure the bigger investment in high - end scre￭ ens .
the fo￭ x￭ con￭ n factory near steve jobs road is rumor￭ ed by brazilian media to already be producing i￭ phones and is expected to start chur￭ ning out ip￭ ad tablets by december for sale to brazil '￭ s growing middle class .
the company , whose main listed vehicle is hon hai precision industry co ltd , has already hired more than 1 , 000 people in jun￭ di￭ ai , a medium - sized city an hour away from sa￭ o paul￭ o , to work at a new plant .
tablet sales in brazil will jump to 450 , 000 this year from 105 , 000 - 110 , 000 last year , according to consulting firm id￭ c , sur￭ ging to above 1 million next year .
that is significant growth - but the 60 percent of brazilian households without a computer w￭ o n '￭ t necessarily rush out to buy tablets , cautioned jose mar￭ tim ju￭ ac￭ ida , an analyst with the company .
last week , fare￭ ed zakaria traveled to iran to interview president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
fare￭ ed '￭ s trip occurred just weeks after the united states accused iran of plotting to assass￭ inate the saudi ambassador to the u ￭.￭ s ￭. and just as president obama announced the up￭ coming withdrawal of u ￭.￭ s ￭. troops from iraq .
fare￭ ed considered the former a sign of iran '￭ s milit￭ ar￭ ization and the latter a strategic bo￭ on to tehran .
fare￭ ed was in iran at a time when its leadership is locked in an internal power struggle with president ahmadinejad up against supreme leader ayatollah khamen￭ ei .
this has led one gps analyst to ask whether ahmadinejad will effectively be iran '￭ s last president .
and as the winds of change sweep the arab world , they seem to stop at iran '￭ s borders .
here are some reasons why there has n '￭ t been an iranian spring ' .
but clearly discontent bubbles within .
just look at this surprising best￭ selling book in tehran .
fare￭ ed found iran surprisingly clean and its urban women relatively liber￭ ated .
he spoke with analysts in iran who explained why , despite what westerners might expect , ahmadinejad is actually a re￭ former when compared with the ayatollah .
and fare￭ ed saw the effect of sanctions up close .
the interview with president ahmadinejad was striking as well .
the president offered a rather unique interpretation of zi￭ on￭ ism , proposed an odd political experiment and defended his country '￭ s soft policies toward syria .
as expected , he denied iran '￭ s nuclear weapons ambitions and condemned the united states for myriad alleged wr￭ on￭ gs .
and ahmadinejad argued that nato '￭ s mission in libya exac￭ er￭ b￭ ated the conflict .
we '￭ ve been paying a lot of attention to iran over the past few weeks .
you can read all our coverage here .
in the coming days , we '￭ ll be presenting some broader analytical pieces to make sense of it all .
i invite you to join us in sharing your impressions and analyses below .
i was in saudi arabia when king fa￭ h￭ d died in 2005 .
there was genuine remorse among saud￭ is young and old at the passing of the king .
portraits of the king covered car windows for weeks - a spontaneous and unprecedented outburst of saudi national grief .
there was also hope that the new king , abdullah , would help bring saudi arabia into the twenty - first century .
that dream ended yesterday with the appointment of prince n￭ ay￭ ef bin abdul aziz as crown prince , or de fac￭ to ruler of saudi arabia as king abdullah continues to undergo hospital treatment for his declining health condition .
in the corridors of power in washington , dc , and london there was some relief that prince n￭ ay￭ ef , as expected , had become crown prince .
in contrast , young saud￭ is on twitter , saudi democracy activists and vocal women were filled with fore￭ bo￭ ding as to what lies ahead in their country .
granted , n￭ ay￭ ef has been a vo￭ ci￭ ferous enemy of al qaeda elements inside saudi arabia and eliminated hundreds of oper￭ atives , while arresting thousands since 2003 .
but this was not because he opposed jihadi ideology or islamist thinking .
his public attacks on the muslim brotherhood come not because he differs with their brand of sal￭ afi islam , but because they seek to undermine the house of saud .
the general conference for unesco gets underway in paris monday when the u ￭.￭ n ￭. agency is expected to vote whether or not to accept a palestinian bid for full membership .
in september , palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas made a bid for the united nations to recognize a palestinian state .
and unesco is the first agency that the palestinians have sought to join .
any recognition of palestine as a member state would not only jeop￭ ardi￭ ze the hope for a resumption of direct israeli - palestinian negotiations , but would endanger the united states contribution to unesco , said an october 13 letter signed by members of the house appropri￭ ations sub￭ committee on state and foreign operations , which appropri￭ ates unesco '￭ s u ￭.￭ s ￭. funding .
this is consistent with current law and i will consider additional actions as needed , she said this month .
there are consequences for short - cutting the process , not only for the palestinians , but for our long￭ standing relationship with the united nations .
she was referring to a provision of 22 us￭ c 2￭ 87 e which states : no funds authorized to be appropri￭ ated by this act or any other act shall be available for the united nations or any specialized agency thereof which accor￭ ds the palestine liberation organization the same standing as member states .
a humanitarian crisis lo￭ oms in thailand after the worst floods in decades left parts of bang￭ k￭ ok and other areas of the country submerged , relief agencies warned sunday .
bang￭ k￭ ok '￭ s central business district has so far avoided major flooding , but many of the areas nearby are chest - or waist - deep in water , forcing residents to flee their homes .
the thai government has set up more than 1 , 700 shelters across the country , where more than 113 , 000 people have taken refuge since flooding began in july after heavy monsoon rains .
more than 3￭ 70 people have died , and charities working in the country have warned of the risk of water - and insect - borne diseases such as diarr￭ he￭ a , dengue fever and malaria in the coming days and weeks .
thai officials warned residents in the capital to be vigil￭ ant and expect disruptions with electricity and tap water .
unicef said it was providing 20 , 000 mosqu￭ ito nets , and handing out 20 , 000 pam￭ ph￭ lets explaining how to stay safe and healthy in flood - hit regions .
the red cross said it had provided more than 130 , 000 relief k￭ its , and 120 , 000 packs of bottled water , but representatives in bang￭ k￭ ok said they were concerned at the lack of food and drinking water in communities isolated by the flood￭ waters .
officials in the capital have warned residents to expect interruptions to electricity and tap water supplies .
the metro￭ pol￭ itan water￭ works authority said it had reduced the amount of tap water processed for residents from 900 , 000 to 400 , 000 cubic meters per day , because of high al￭ ga￭ e counts at one of its plants .
the prime minister said authorities would speed up the process of dra￭ ining water into bang￭ k￭ ok '￭ s canals and into the sea , raising hopes that water levels in the city could start to sink .
however , the government has warned it may take more than a month for the floods to rec￭ ed￭ e .
co￭ ch￭ ran￭ e said the country still faced a variety of threats , including strong currents , disease and even cro￭ co￭ d￭ ile and snake attacks .
but he said it was vital that authorities and charities also start to look beyond the immediate dangers .
three afghan security guards and one afghan civilian were killed in the attack , said gen . hamid war￭ da￭ g , a local commander of the afghan national army .
in addition , two assailants were shot to death by afghan security forces , the general said .
war￭ da￭ g said a truck full of explosives blew up in front of the international relief and development office .
the explosion was followed by gunfire .
some armed taliban have taken position at the building at this moment and are fighting back , war￭ da￭ g said monday morning .
a few hours later , war￭ da￭ g said the shooting had stopped , but a search for gunmen continued inside the building .
international relief and development speci￭ ali￭ zes in helping areas affected by conflict and war recover and improve , according to its website .
kandahar province has seen a rash of recent violence .
on thursday , insurgents launched attacks on a provincial reconstruction team base and a military outpost , afghan and nato officials said .
insurgents fired small guns and rocket - prop￭ elled grenades ( r￭ p￭ gs ) toward the provincial reconstruction team , said agha l￭ ali , a member of the kandahar provincial council .
officials killed two of the attackers , according to a regional police chief .
and on october 22 , three u ￭.￭ s ￭. service members were killed when an improvised explosive device blew up near their assault force .
after seven months of an aerial bombing campaign that helped de￭ pose long￭ time ruler mo￭ ammar gadhafi , nato officially ends its mission in libya on monday .
nato '￭ s move comes after the united nations security council last week res￭ cin￭ ded its march mandate for military intervention to protect civilians targeted during anti - regime protests .
liby￭ ans have now liber￭ ated their country and they have transformed the region , said nato secretary - general anders fo￭ gh ras￭ mus￭ sen on friday .
this is their victory .
our operation for libya will end on october 31 .
until then , together with our partners , we will continue to monitor the situation .
and if needed , we will continue to respond to threats to civilians , ras￭ mus￭ sen said .
we '￭ re very concerned that , as we move forward , that the authorities make maximum effort to swiftly form an inclu￭ sive government that incorpor￭ ates all aspects of libyan society , and in which the rights of all libyan people are fully and thoroughly respected , regardless of their gender , their religion , their region of origin , rice said after the security council vote last thursday .
all of the events that have taken place since february 2011 and the murder of gadhafi , all of this means we are totally in our right to call upon the international criminal court , said mar￭ cel c￭ ec￭ cal￭ di , a lawyer representing the family said last week .
nato '￭ s libya campaign began in march , after the security council adopted resolution 1973 , which imposed a no - fly zone in the country '￭ s airspace and authorized member states to take measures to protect civilians .
the trial of former egyptian president hosni mubarak was put on hold for two months pen￭ ding a decision on whether to replace the judge , his lawyer told cnn on sunday .
the delay comes because attorneys for victims of the uprising that toppled mubarak objected to the judge pre￭ si￭ ding over the case , said the lawyer , farid el dee￭ b .
the judge is not firm enough , said khaled abu bak￭ r , a lawyer representing one of the victims .
he did not allow many of them into the court and did not give them enough time to ask their questions , especially in the testimony of general tantawi .
they face charges over the killing of protesters in the demonstrations that led mubarak to resign in february , and over corruption while in office .
lawyers representing the families of the dead protesters pe￭ ti￭ tioned a higher court demanding a new panel of judges because of unfair treatment of lawyers representing civilians .
japan '￭ s ministry of finance intervened in the currency market for the first time since august to weaken the yen , sending the currency down as much as 5 ￭.￭ 1 per cent against the us dollar .
ju￭ n az￭ um￭ i , finance minister , confirmed that the bank of japan was acting on the m￭ of '￭ s orders to halt the yen '￭ s specul￭ ative rise , after the currency touched 75 ￭.￭ 35 , a new post￭ war high , earlier in the day .
the japanese currency climbed last week even as the bo￭ j eased monetary policy , increasing the size of its asset - purchasing programme by 10 per cent , and in spite of economic data from the us that were mostly encouraging .
the action had an immediate effect , sending the yen down to 79 ￭.￭ 49 .
mas￭ af￭ um￭ i y￭ am￭ am￭ oto , chief currency strateg￭ ist at bar￭ cla￭ ys capital , said the traditional correlation between the dollar / yen rate and us - japan yield gaps had broken down in recent weeks , suggesting that the direction of the currency was not being steered by fundamentals .
to some extent , [ today '￭ s action ] fil￭ ls the gap between the actual dollar / yen level and the rational level suggested by yield differ￭ entials , said y￭ uno￭ su￭ ke i￭ ke￭ da , head of f￭ x strategy at nom￭ ura .
still , the timing of the move came as a surprise to some , given that the nik￭ ke￭ i index and yen crosses had both been relatively steady .
this is likely to have been a single - shot intervention .
repeated currency intervention is likely to be regarded as currency manipulation , which is not allowed under the g ￭7 framework , said mr i￭ ke￭ da .
in recent cases of intervention , the government '￭ s style has been minimum frequency , but maximum size , said mr y￭ am￭ am￭ oto of bar￭ cap .
if today '￭ s intervention stops the down￭ ward movement in dollar / yen , there will be no follow - through tomorrow , but it all depends on how the currency moves in later sessions .
nine americans , including four u ￭.￭ s ￭. troops , were among those killed in a suicide bombing in afghanistan '￭ s capital this weekend , a western diplomat told cnn sunday .
saturday '￭ s blast - which also claimed the lives of two british civilians , a ko￭ so￭ vo national and a canadian soldier - occurred when a car packed with explosives struck an armored bus in a nato convoy , the diplomat said .
authorities have not released identities of the other victims .
a diplomatic source said the two british citizens who were killed were civilian contractors working for isaf .
afghan president hamid karzai offered his sympath￭ ies at a national security meeting sunday .
afghan people are gri￭ eved by the nato loss of lives and share the pain and sorrow with the families and friends of the troops killed , he said .
a taliban spokesman confirmed saturday '￭ s attack in a text message , saying it killed 16 foreign soldiers , one civilian and injured many others .
taliban casualty counts are often infl￭ ated ; there was no other reliable indication 16 foreigners were killed .
attackers fired rocket - prop￭ elled grenades and small arms at coalition troops who were assisting afghan forces at the site of a land dispute , the statement said .
no isaf forces were injured or killed , the statement said .
the fighting erupted after the taliban convinced members of a tribe that they should attack a convoy carrying government officials to recla￭ im their land , said haji le￭ wani , a tribal elder in the province .
about 20 taliban insurgents and seven tribesmen were among the dead , he said .
also saturday , a gun￭ man wearing an afghan army uniform turned his weapon on coalition forces during training , killing three and wounding several others , isaf said .
the shoo￭ ter was killed in the incident in southern afghanistan .
an un￭ manned russian rocket successfully lifted off with a cargo of supplies for the crew of the international space station on sunday , two months after a similar rocket crashed in si￭ ber￭ ia .
the progress 45 fre￭ igh￭ ter is slated to dock with the station on wednesday with three tons of food , fuel , water and spare parts for the u ￭.￭ s ￭. , russian and japanese crew of the station .
the vessel took off from russia '￭ s baikonur cosmo￭ drome in kazakhstan at 4 : 11 p ￭.￭ m ￭. ( 6 : 11 a ￭.￭ m ￭. et ) and reached its preliminary or￭ bit in nine minutes , the u ￭.￭ s ￭. space agency nasa said .
the launch follows a failed launch in august , when another progress crashed into the si￭ ber￭ ian wilderness .
it was the first such crash in the craft '￭ s 30 - year service history , but space officials said the station '￭ s three - member crew was never in any danger of running out of food or water .
in a written statement , nasa '￭ s manned space flight chief , bill ger￭ sten￭ ma￭ ier , said the launch sets the stage for the next scheduled crew rotation aboard the iss in november .
